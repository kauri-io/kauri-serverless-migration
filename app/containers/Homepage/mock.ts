While this speed of development is exciting, it can be overwhelming for both new and experienced Ethereum developers to find up to date and accurate information. \\n\\nKauri aims to create a set of resources to help developers quickly understand what they can build with Ethereum and related web3 tools. This involves a combination of education, demonstration, and discovery. It requires input and help from a community of contributors, technical, non-technical, and everyone in-between. To further the process of building these communities, we\'re excited to announce the Community Ambassador Program!\\n\\nThe goal of the program is to enable community members to identify, create and curate the quality technical content necessary for developers to succeed in building web3-enabled applications and dApps. We believe this requires designating members the Ambassador of a content area, and providing them with resources, feedback, and exposure. \\n\\n<br>\\n**Community Ambassadors will receive the following:**\\n\\n* Up to $3,000 USD as a bounty pool to help seed content, with the potential for additional funding in the future\\n\\n* Editorial control over their designated Kauri Community, and the ability to appoint additional moderators\\n\\n* Regular help, editing, and feedback from the Kauri team and our technical writers\\n\\n* Weekly office Hours with top developers and writers from Kauri, ConsenSys, and the wider ecosystem\\n\\n* Exposure through the Kauri marketing channels, and partner newsletters\\n\\n<br>\\n**Here’s what we’re expecting from our Community Ambassadors:**\\n\\n* Manage content for a community, including:\\n\\n    * Planning the structure of the content to maximize developer success\\n\\n    * Identifying and filling content gaps\\n\\n    * Writing and editing content\\n\\n    * Sourcing and curating existing content\\n\\n* Organizing content for targeted developer groups (e.g entry level/ foundational, intermediate, advanced)\\n\\n* Organize the community home page\\n\\n* Organize articles into collections\\n\\n* Recruit writers to the community\\n\\n* Manage community moderators and admins\\n\\n* Keeping the community up to date with latest trends and developments\\n\\n* Promote the community in social channels, community hot spots (Discord, Discourse, Telegram, etc)\\n\\n<br>\\n**Examples of communities we’d love to see: (Note: this list is not comprehensive, and we’d love suggestions!)**\\n\\n* Ethereum for Python developers\\n\\n* Decentralized Finance\\n\\n* Privacy and Cryptography\\n\\n* Scaling (Sharding, State Channels, ETH 2.0, SideChains)\\n\\n* Solidity and Vyper\\n\\n* EVM\\n\\n<br>\\nIf this sounds interesting, please [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPB8KRCSEzFZo-PTgJaPq1Frtu00_PtWJt_oLYr2gECHZw4Q/viewform)!

I teach developers and non-developers on how to use the Ethereum Blockchain. If you enjoy this content on Libra and want to learn more about blockchain, I highly recommend you sign up for [the Developer Program On-Demand.](https://learn.consensys.net/catalog/info/id:141?utm_source=kauri&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=libra)_\\n\\nEven though Facebook\'s name is hard to find on [the Libra website](https://libra.org), the long term plan is for it to integrate with their forthcoming [Calibra wallet](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/06/coming-in-2020-calibra/), and then, the whole game plan might make more sense. For now, the intention of Libra appears to a global currency, maybe for those who have little access to banks, or maybe for the global citizens of Facebook.\\n\\nWith partnerships with major \\"old finance\\" enterprises on board such as Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and Visa, it\'s hard to know if Libra will be the injection that cryptocurrencies have always needed or the end of cryptocurrencies as we all know them.\\n\\nWe don\'t know for now, but in this post, we take a quick look through the getting started guide for the project and what we can accomplish with it. This is early days for the project, and we tested quickly, so some details are missing.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmVQ4zYoysUEc4bB1U59eVBF284NVT7hEbBhCiFVQmV9Zo)\\n\\nWe followed [the setup instructions in the documentation](https://developers.libra.org/docs/my-first-transaction#clone-and-build-libra-core) on macOS which worked with out any issues and downloaded any dependencies missing from our local system.\\n\\nWe noticed that Libra is using [rocksdb](https://rocksdb.org) for storage, which is unsurprising as it\'s a popular option and also created by Facebook. There are other dependencies, mostly used for cryptography and storage, you can see the full list in the various _Cargo.toml_ files in the repository. Which also shows that most of Libra is written in Rust. Interestingly we noticed that Libra uses the [Rust Bitcoin hashes](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes) project for hashing, plus a handful of Parity labs modules.\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmYkHTwBEuNrEJD9VpPJySN5VRPbvm9naoioQ3We2tQCr7)\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmVeFKQwJoKAGzmPbqx8ZwbbiJkKzhYCc5Vke7n1cRATab)\\n\\n## Build and connect\\n\\nAfter setup, [you can build the CLI client and connect to the testnet](https://developers.libra.org/docs/my-first-transaction#build-libra-cli-client-and-connect-to-the-testnet). This takes some time and uses a reasonable amount of your computer resources, but again completed with no issues. At the end of the build process, your local machine connects to a validator node and provides you with an interface to the node.\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmQ8yfWSAaw9VcfQgAEFzBe6QdyJrVtaKLXM9s8VoN2789)\\n\\n[Next, we tried creating accounts](https://developers.libra.org/docs/my-first-transaction#create-alice-s-and-bob-s-account), which worked fine. There are three main functions: `account`, `query`, `transfer`; all of which are relatively self-explanatory. In this step of the tutorial, we create two accounts, each of which has their own index and hex address. You can use the index value instead of the address in other CLI commands to reference the account you want to interact with.\\n\\n## Add coins\\n\\n[Next, we add Libra coins using a time-honored faucet](https://developers.libra.org/docs/my-first-transaction#add-libra-coins-to-alice-s-and-bob-s-accounts). We noticed that the testnet faucet has a limit of 5 requests per minute, which is not realistic for a real-world payment option, hopefully, this is just testnet rate limiting.\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmUtmEMhSd97NF7s7fqAfNJuZuMix3kgW8DGLAKCaYM4XY)\\n\\nAt this point, we also noticed that using the `query account_state 0` command returned a couple of interesting field values, including a `Blockchain version` value, a \\"sequence number\\" (kind of like a nonce). The account also had a state before we have yet pushed the account values to the blockchain. This is different from Ethereum or Bitcoin and means that either account generation must also have an event which pings testnet or that if it\'s a valid account number, Libra returns its balance as \\"none\\", but validates it\'s a compliant address.\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmbbYY1b1iv2WgH8oAM4ZBDSVTJ1PpjC5dmAMvRwTU1ayi)\\n\\n_Update 1: [Reading the technical whitepaper](chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/https://developers.libra.org/docs/assets/papers/the-libra-blockchain.pdf) found this:_\\n\\n_\\"The new account is created in the ledger state when a transaction sent from an existing account invokes the\\n`create_account(a)` Move [ed: Libra’s blockchain VM language] instruction. This typically happens when a transaction attempts to send Libra to an account at address a that has not yet been created\\"_\\n\\n_Update 2: Blockchain Version seems more similar to block number. From the whitepaper:_\\n\\n_\\"All data in the Libra Blockchain is stored in a single versioned database. A version number is an unsigned 64-bit integer **that corresponds to the number of transactions the system has executed.\\"**_\\n\\n## Submit transaction\\n\\n[Next, we tried sending a transaction between accounts](https://developers.libra.org/docs/my-first-transaction#submit-a-transaction). This step reintroduces the sequence value mentioned above, as you can query the sequence to understand the number of transactions on each account so far. Once you have submitted the transaction, you can query for the status to find out when the validator node has accepted it. You can also use a \\"blocking transfer\\" to only return to the client when a validator node has validated a transaction.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nWhat\'s most interesting about Libra is that we\'re seeing how another set of engineers maybe not so steeped in the crypto-world would build a blockchain. That\'s not to say their choices are better or worse, but it\'s interesting.\\n\\nWho knows what Facebook (sorry Libra\'s) aim with this new crypto currency is, but in the meantime, if you\'re working on a DeFi project, it may be a well engineered solution that\'s worth investigating.\\n"}',

This guide will show you how to start feeding Web 2.0 API data into your Ethereum smart contract in no time. For a general overview of what a decentralized oracle is and why it is needed, have a look at our previous article:\\n\\n[Why your Decentralized Application Needs a Decentralized Oracle\\n](https://medium.com/iex-ec/why-your-dapp-needs-a-decentralized-oracle-2f2403f9fd7)\\n\\nIf earning some RLC while learning about decentralized oracles is something that interests you, check out [our developer training reward program](https://medium.com/iex-ec/decentralized-oracles-get-started-earn-rlc-6064aa95a2f9)!\\n\\nIn the following guide, we are going to see how to fetch the price of any crypto pair (ex: ETH/USD) from an API on the internet and put it back into a smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. Such a mechanism is called a price feed oracle and is one of the many use cases enabled by iExec’s decentralized cloud.\\n\\nAll the terminal commands part of this tutorial were run on a macOS machine. If using Linux, you can use almost all the same commands. However, Windows users may need to adapt OS-specific commands and install apps such as Git Bash — but we can not provide full tech support. If you encounter any issues while following the tutorial, our developers we’ll be happy to help or receive feedback on [Slack](http://slack.iex.ec), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/iExecBlockchainComputing/Lobby), or [Telegram](https://t.me/iexec_discussion).\\n\\n\\n# 0. Pre-Requirements\\n\\n## Install OS specific compiling libs\\n\\n### On MacOS\\n\\nEnsure that you installed the Xcode Command Line Tool.\\n\\n### On Linux\\n\\nsudo apt-get update\\nsudo apt-get install python\\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\\n\\n### On Windows 10\\n\\nUnless you are a Windows power user or Windows addict, and installing Visual Studio to be able to compile c++ doesn’t sound terrifying for you, then you may consider using Windows Subsystem for Linux (to get a linux shell integrated in Windows) or you could just install Virtualbox and launch a Linux VM.\\n\\n## Install Docker\\n\\n### On MacOS\\n\\nGo on Docker website, sign up and install Docker Desktop. Once successfully installed, log in Docker Desktop. Ensure that Docker Desktop is up by running in your terminal:\\n\\n```\\ndocker --version\\n\\n```\\n\\n### On Linux\\n\\nGo on this Docker documentation page explaining how to install Docker on Ubuntu (all Linux flavors are supported). Ensure Docker is installed by running:\\n\\n```\\ndocker --version\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Create a repository on DockerHub.\\n\\nHead over dockerhub, create a repository and name it price-feed.\\n\\n## Install NodeJS\\n\\nThe cleanest way to install node on Linux & MacOS is by using theNVM installer. Run the below command to install NodeJS on your system:\\n\\n```\\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash  #works for MacOS & Linux\\ncommand -v nvm #should output \'nvm\' if installation worked\\nnvm install node 10.12  # this will install latest stable node version\\nnvm use node  #make nvm installed node the system\'s default node\\n```\\n\\nEnsure that NodeJS is up by running in your terminal.\\n\\n```\\nnode --version\\n\\n```\\n\\nOn Windows, download the NodeJS Windows installer from their official website.\\n\\n## Instal the iExec SDK\\n\\nThe iExec SDK is a node module. To install it, just run:\\n\\n```\\nnpm -g install iexec\\n\\n```\\n\\nEnsure that iExec SDK is correctly installed by running:\\n\\n```\\niexec --version\\n\\n```\\n\\nThat’s it for the prerequisites, that’s a one shot install. Next part is about setting up your DOracle project (like create and fill your Ethereum wallet).\\n\\n\\n# 1. Initialize the project\\n\\nNow let’s initialize our new price-feed oracle project:\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/Qma1Djst8y5thvKFvHpZBxiwuomQxBKzrP8Byy7thLNrQw)\\n\\n```\\nmkdir price-feed  #new folder\\ncd price-feed  #enter the folder\\niexec init  #init iexec project. If you already have an iExec wallet, run iexec init --skip-wallet to keep using your current wallet\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe last command will create an Ethereum wallet.\\n\\n**Important**: choose a password and save it (you will need it after).\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmT7JKod4t8Zag7kpwRutjLvL4RWqJyZUgioF22f8p5a9a)\\n\\nGreat! Now that you have a wallet (it is saved as a .json file in your machine user folder. ex: ) let’s get some ETH to interact with the Ethereum Blockchain, and some RLC to interact with the iExec’s platform.\\n\\nReminder: All commands in this tutorial that interact with the Blockchain will use the Kovan testnet blockchain. It works identically to Ethereum Mainnet, but doesn’t require real money to get started. Perfect for testing!\\n\\nLet’s ask iExec for some free Kovan RLC:\\n\\n```\\niexec wallet getRLC --chain kovan\\n\\n```\\n\\nAt this stage, you should see your Wallet displayed in your terminal with a credit of 200 nRLC.\\n\\nNow to get some free Kovan ETH, you will need to post your Ethereum wallet address in a Gitter group chat. Let’s show our wallet address:\\n\\n```\\niexec wallet show --chain kovan\\n\\n```\\n\\nLet’s go over the Kovan Faucet Gitter, sign in to Gitter and copy-paste your wallet address in the discussion.\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmWQVJvHP7wxvWRi9X58RqEFt6d2w9fRwcfN5nKcXR9vzt)\\n\\nPaste your wallet address on the chatbox to receive 3.0 Kovan ETH.\\n\\nBefore going further, we need to ensure that our wallet received the ETH and the RLC we asked for. Run this command to check your wallet balance:\\n\\n```\\niexec wallet show --chain kovan\\n\\n```\\n\\nYour balance should show you 3.0 ETH and 200 nRLC. If not, wait for a minute.\\n\\nNow let’s top up our iExec account and move on to the next section:\\n\\n```\\niexec account deposit 200 --chain kovan\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# 2. Deploy your off-chain application\\n\\nIn order to run the price-feed application on the iExec’s decentralized cloud, we need to go through the following steps:\\n\\n1. Dockerize the “price-feed” application,\\n2. Push it on the DockerHub public registry\\n3. Deploy it on the iExec’s Platform\\n\\nEnsure that your terminal is in the price-feed folder, and let’s create a new folder named app, containing the off-chain logic:\\n\\n```\\nmkdir app \\ncd app  # enter the folder\\n```\\n\\nThen download the price-feed JS script that implements the price fetching logic (we encourage you to have a look at the JS code):\\n\\n```\\ncurl -o ./price-feed.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-apps/master/PriceFeed/src/oracle.js\\n```\\n\\nNow, let’s dockerize our JS application. The first step is to open your IDE (Developer environment), create a file named Dockerfile in the app folder, and paste below content in it:\\n\\n```\\nFROM node:11-alpine\\nCOPY price-feed.js /src/price-feed.js\\nRUN npm i https ethers fs\\nENTRYPOINT [\\"node\\", \\"src/price-feed.js\\"]\\n\\n```\\n\\nAt this stage, we are ready to build the Docker image and publish it to dockerhub. In your terminal, run these commands:\\ndocker build .  #write down your image ID (it appears after the text \\"successfully built 19acce70289d\\" <-- that is the image ID)\\n\\nYou’ve built a docker image. Now we want to tag this image with our dockerhub username:\\n\\n```\\ndocker tag <IMAGE_ID> <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME>/price-feed:1.0.0  #ex: docker tag 19acce70289d iexechub/price-feed\\n```\\n\\nFinally, we can push our local image to the dockerhub public repository:\\n\\n```\\ndocker push <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME>/price-feed  #write down your image digest (it appears after sha256:959eb75b13efb41a8f37495784150574d66175adebd0c6c18216b482c574d109 <-- this is your image digest)\\nNow we are just a few steps from having our application being “iExec’s ready”:\\ncd ..  #move to upper folder\\niexec app init  #tell the SDK that you want to create an app\\n```\\n\\nThen, open the newly created “iexec.json” file, and edit these three fields:\\n\\n- **owner**: “Your_key_wallet”\\n- **name**: We name it “PriceFeed”.\\n- **multiaddr**: replace by dockerhub repository name. “registry.hub.docker.com/<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME>/price-feed:1.0.0”.\\n- **checksum**: given by the command docker push. (add 0x before the sha256:)\\n\\nNow let’s deploy your price-feed application on iExec, in the terminal:\\n\\n```\\niexec app deploy --chain kovan  #that is a blockchain transaction\\n```\\n\\nCongrats! Your Price-Feed App is now deployed on the iExec platform.\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmbpEfN9nt7Vyh5d7VEQTuj8SpaS3pU8TSMV99jLPqcYio)\\n\\nFinally, let’s publish sell orders for your application, so iExec platform users are able to use your application at the price you write on the orders:\\n\\n```\\niexec order init --app\\niexec order sign --app\\niexec order publish --app # publish your apporder on the marketplace and get an orderHash\\niexec order show --app [orderHash]\\n```\\n\\n\\n# 3. Deploy your on-chain DOracle Smart Contract\\n\\nLet’s clone the repo on your terminal, enter the smart-contract folder, and install JS dependencies:\\n\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/price-feed-doracle.git smart-contract\\ncd smart-contract\\nnpm install\\n```\\n\\nIn order to deploy the smart contract on the Blockchain, you need to tell Truffle your wallet private key. Here is how you can show your wallet’s private key:\\n\\n```\\ncd ..  # move to upper folder\\niexec wallet show --show-private-key  # copy your private key for next step\\n```\\n\\nNow you are ready to deploy. Thanks to truffle, that’s as simple as this:\\n\\n```\\ncd smart-contract # move back to the smart-contract folder\\nMNEMONIC=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> ./node_modules/.bin/truffle migrate --network kovan # Deploy your smart contract to the Blockchain\\n```\\n\\n![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmXGPhn8fYCYyi2ctznrCXmpAtPFwhyTvh2Zwtq8F21aHw)\\n\\nGreat, your DOracle smart contract is now deployed on Kovan testnet blockchain. How about feeding it with the ETH/USD price?\\n\\n## 4. Update your DOracle (as a requester)\\n\\nNow let’s buy a “price-feed” run on iExec by running these commands on your terminal:\\n\\n```\\ncd ..  # move back to parent folder price-feed\\n```\\n\\nLet’s show the unique ID (order hash) of the orders we want to buy. One is the workerpool order, and the other one is our price feed app order:\\n\\n```\\niexec orderbook workerpool --category 2 # copy the workerpool order hash\\niexec orderbook app <address>  # copy the app order hash\\n```\\n\\nNow we want to fill the orders (workerpool + app), that’s as simple as running:\\n\\n```\\niexec order fill --app <APP_ORDER_HASH> --workerpool <WORKERPOOL_ORDER_HASH> --params \\"RLC BTC 9 2019-07-09T13:27:24.909Z\\" --chain kovan  # start the DOracle computation!\\n```\\n\\nThat’s it! we sent to the iExec platform the computation request. To ensure we all talk the same language, you now have a deal, and in that deal, there is one task (that’s a way to enable the coming bag of task feature). Let’s track the progress of the computation by using these commands:\\n\\n```\\niexec deal show <DEAL_ID> --tasks 0 --chain kovan\\niexec task show <TASK_ID> --watch --chain kovan\\n```\\n\\nYou can also head over the [iExec Explorer](https://explorer.iex.ec) to track your tasks. After a few minutes, the status should turn to “completed”.\\n\\nSo what happened so far? We ask a workerpool to run our price-feed application, the workers fetched the ETH/USD price, the result is validated by the PoCo, and as soon as there is consensus, it is stored back into iExec’s smart contracts. Last step consists of calling the function named “_iexecDoracleGetVerifiedResult” on your DOracle smart contract, so it will check the result stored on the iExec’s smart contract, run some filtering logic (ex: is the new price associated with a UTC date more recent than the previous one I pulled), and if all your custom conditions are fulfilled, then it will update itself with the new ETH/USD price! Makes sense?\\n\\nWe will soon update the article with a truffle script to show this last step. If you can’t wait, just try by yourself! Also, we encourage you to try out our price-feed frontend to see what the end-user experience could look like: [https://price-feed-doracle.iex.ec](https://explorer.iex.ec)\\n\\nThat’s it! We hope you realized how easy it is to build a decentralized oracle on iExec.\\n\\nIf you liked it, then you definitely want to learn more about our dev training reward program that makes building DOracle on iExec fun & financially rewarding:\\n\\n[Decentralized Oracles: Get Started & Earn RLC](https://medium.com/iex-ec/decentralized-oracles-get-started-earn-rlc-6064aa95a2f9)\\n\\nBear in mind that the dev team is reachable on [Slack](http://slack.iex.ec), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/iExecBlockchainComputing/Lobby), and [Telegram](https://t.me/iexec_discussion).\\n"}',

It is not intended to be an exhaustive list, since there are so many products and services in the defi space, and is rapidly growing. There are different degrees of decentralisation, and transparency, but all of them make good use of smart contracts. Most of the dapps are running on the etherium platform, since they are the most mature of the smart contract platforms. But there are new ones being developed on platforms like EOS, IOST and other blockchains. This list is summarised, and I will probably drill down into more detail in future articles, and cover other related topics. If you are holding onto your coins like I do, there is really no good reason not to invest them, by staking or lending them out. You can decide to use variable rates which are determined by the market and fluctuate, or lock them in with fixed rates if you prefer (ex. 30 days, 60 days etc.). Also stable coins are a good way to hedge your risk against volatility, and the rates are much better than the traditional banks and trust companies (ex. 10-14% vs. 2%)\\n\\nVariable interest rate systems (Pooling model which doesn't require order matching)\\nCelsius (https://celsius.network)\\nThis is a centralised, but transparent lending/borrowing platform. They use a custodial service called Bitgo which is regulated in the US, audited and insured. The good news is that you don't have to manage, and worry about the private keys. They support the major crypto currencies for lending and borrowing. Rates are listed on the main web site page and in the app, which runs on mobile only. The interest is paid out regularly once a week in kind (same as the lending coin) or in CEL tokens which gives better rates for loyalty. Your choice. The system is extremely easy to use, and the team is very good, as well as the support. It is led by Alex Machinsky who was one of the early pioneers of VOIP (voice over IP). After taking down the telecom giants, he is now after the big banks who he feels have been taking advantage, and are ripe for disruption, with MOIP (money over IP) There are many useful statistics on the app, like transactions, total interest earned, and you can also follow the growth of the community, with assets under management and total loans. They give back 80​% of revenue on borrowing to the community in the form of interest to lenders, and the rest is for expenses like salaries etc. Their goal is to bring millions of new people into crypto, and they have grown very rapidly in the first year. They are very active on social media, and Alex speaks at many conferences all over the world. They have pledged to make more and more information available about their funds and how they are being invested and distributed to the community. Nexo is a similar service to celsius, but not as big, and I had some technical problems (which were eventually resolved) but that is why I didnt cover it here. As far as I am concerned Celsius network is \\\"Best of Breed\\\". \\n\\nCompound V2/Zerion (https://compound.finance / https://zerion.io/en\\nThis is a very good decentralised service, and all the data is made available thru API, so it is very transparent. Version 2 made a lot of improvements. Other defi services can connect to the lending platform, and Zerion has taken advantage of this. Zerion has swapping, and margin trading as well as lending thru Compound. All the transactions are made directly from your wallet, and you control the private keys.They also support a few stable coins.  You can check your balances inside the app, or across apps by using defitracker.io. You can also check current interest rates for lending and borrowing by using loanscan.io. Interest is calculated and compounded on every block. It is paid out in Cdai, or Ceth depending on the coin invested. \\n\\nNuo (https://nuo.network)\\nNuo is a similar decentralised lending/borrowing service but supports more coins, and usually good rates. But they don't support swapping/exchanging for one coin to another, so you have to use Uniswap for that. You can also check the lowest rates for coin swapping by using dex.ag. \\n\\nREX (https://eosrex.io)\\nThe Resource exchange is for staking EOS on their blockchain. You are staking unused resource capacity like RAM, CPU and network bandwidth, so that others can lease them (such as Dapp providers) at a reasonable fee.The lending rates are pretty low for now, but this may increase over time depending on market demands. Its quite easy to use, and there are a number of front-ends that can be employed. The one that I am using is at EOSauthority. \\n\\nFixed interest rate systems (P2P model with order matching)\\nDharma (https://www.dharma.io)\\nIf you are looking for fixed interest rates for a fixed time period (3o days for example), then this is the best service to use, But you have to create an order, and wait for it to be matched. This is supposed to take about 24-48 hours, and you won't earn interest until the order is accepted. The service is decentralised, and works with smart contracts which have been audited. \\n\\nCred (https://uphold.com/en/apps/app/credearn)\\nThis is also a fixed rate for a fixed period, but the service is centralized. It was announced that Binance will be partnering with them to provide lending to their exchange customers. It also integrates with uphold, for other crypto banking services. \\n\\nCobo bitgrow contracts (cobo.com)\\nThese are fixed rate for fixed term contracts directly from the cobo wallet. https://medium.com/@cobo_official/cobos-bitgrow-grow-your-crypto-in-the-bearish-market-651bb8223497 I covered other functions of the cobo wallet for staking in my previous article, on Publish0x, or here on Kauro.io\\n\\nChintai for EOS tokens https://chintai.io\\nThe new version 2 is supposed to be coming out any day now, and should offer some interesting improvements to this P2P order matching system for EOS leasing. The new platform has its own token called CHEX. \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI didn't cover all the services, since there are just too many, and new ones appearing all the time. So, I only chose the ones to talk about that I like the best . For example, I didn't cover Maker DAO since it is only for borrowing, and is more complicated since you have to make sure that your loan doesn't get liquidated, since there is a penalty, and the stability fee is very high now (19%). I believe that you are better off using the services mentioned above for lending. \\n\\nAll the etherium based systems use Metamask, and the EOS ones use Scatter. So, you will have to get familiar with those apps if you want to use these services, with the exception of Celsius, which is the easiest to use (once you pass the identity verification process). I have tested all of these services and they all worked well for me. But that doesn't guarantee that you might not come across a bug. Most of the systems have technical support on telegram or discord, and some by email or phone. The more centralised systems tend to be the most responsive but not always. The user interfaces are pretty good, and the systems are always improving, and adding features. In my opinion, this area of crypto is the best reason for the institutional investors to get serious. Even though there are better rates, there are always risks involved. In my opinion, the missing link right now is insurance for things like hacking smart contracts, for example. I am currently following a couple of projects that plan to offer this service, but they aren't quite there yet. I plan to test and evaluate them as soon as they are ready for prime time. In any case, its good to put your money to work for you while you are waiting for the big gain\"}",

I have been testing the staking pool, and interest earning capabilities, as an alternative to Celsius (which I really like – I will also be writing some articles about Celsius finance). There are 3 types of Cobo wallets – Cloud/mobile, Hardware/vault, and custody solution for enterprises. For the purposes of this article, I will be discussing the mobile/cloud wallet and investment capabilities.\\n\\nFor people who are not familiar with staking tokens, there are a lot of articles on the subject. But in short, they allow you earn rewards by staking, or locking up your tokens for a period of time (like REX in the case of EOS). Some projects allow you to delegate to validators, who help to maintain the network integrity and security. In this way, you don\'t have to invest in your own equipment, or large staking requirements, since they are pooled (similar to mining pools in proof of work consensus type systems). \\n\\nIn the case of lending investments, there are fixed and variable types which we will talk about below. \\n\\nCobo Mobile/Cloud Wallet\\n\\nThis is a \\"custodial wallet\\", which means that THEY control the keys. –https://cobo.com/blog/cryptowalletexplained?locale=en\\n\\n​So, there is a certain amount of custodial risk involved (similar to other centralised services like Celsius). Based on my research these are the factors that mitigate the risk, (but keep in mind that there is still a certain amount of trust involved):\\n\\n– With the Proof of Stake (POS), and Flexiplan investments, you can withdraw your funds at any time (see features below). Only the fixed term investments require you to lock-in your funds for a fixed amount of time. So you can avoid the fixed type if you prefer (especially in the beginning, until you have more confidence)\\n\\n– The Cobo community includes a good ecosystem (including Tron, F2pool, IOTX project, Dapp review etc.), and they have a good development team – including Discus Fish, and Dr. Changhao Jiang) https://cobo.com/about\\n\\n– They are quite transparent and any shady practises would be voiced in the community forums (ex Telegram, Facebook etc.). Terms and conditions of each investment are shown, and you should read them, so there are no surprises.\\n\\n– Security is very important to them, and they are audited by 3rd parties – audited by Cure53. They are also very knowledgeable about security, and this is incorporated into all their products\\n\\n– They received $13 million in series A funding from DHVC, and other reputable investors, who must have done due diligence\\n\\n– They have good and responsive support (chat and email support) that I have spoken to several times, and I am a beta tester, so I have been evaluating many of the features for several months. No major problems to speak of, from my experience\\n\\nInvestment services\\n\\n– Proof of stake pools supports many different coins on many different chains, and they offer good rates of return – funds can be withdrawn at any time. This option does not lock you in. \\n\\n– Their “Bitgrow” service has Flexiplan (can withdraw at any time) and fixed term investments (locked in from 30 - 180 days for example). The advantage is that the rates are locked-in in also for the same time period. Flexiplan rates are progressive, and get higher the longer you leave the funds, but you can withdraw them at any time. Fixed plans have fixed APR rates, based on the coin and length of time. Some of the investment plans have to be claimed before they sell out. But there are always new ones coming out for particular coins which they feature\\n\\n– You can earn CC tokens by doing missions (tasks on the site, like using different features). They can be redeemed for other coins or boosts (give you higher rates or limits). These redemption rewards sell out pretty fast, so its better to claim them quickly\\n\\n– They support some airdrops and incentive programs from a few coin projects like Tron/BTT, and IOST for example\\n\\n– They support 3rd party dapps\\n\\n– You can Swap/Exchange one coin for another, which is fast, and the fees are relatively low (they still have to pay the network fees). This can be very useful. But there are some minimum quantities, which will restrict you sometimes. Most of the coins can be exchanged, but not all of them.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis is a different type of investment vehicle than  the Celsius financial platform, which I will discuss in another article. Each one has advantages and disadvantages, and I believe that its good to have both. My evaluation and testing of this service has been good, and it has a lot of going for it. There are a lot of features, and it takes a little while to start getting all the benefits. My only complaint is that it would be nice to have a desktop version, but the mobile version is quite use-able. They don’t seem to do much marketing, so most people have not heard anything about it yet, but I believe that this project will continue to grow, and could be huge in the future – A sleeping giant worth checking out, in my opinion.  Please keep in mind that I am not a financial adviser, and this is not investment advice. Let me know what you think.\\n\\n "}',

I am super excited about the new breed of Defi_Opfi projects that I have been discovering and testing out with great preliminary results. To me, this is where the new \\"killer apps\\" will come from and give the mainstream retail and institutional investors a good reason to adopt crypto currencies and blockchain smart contracts. If you can earn 14% on a decentrlized stable coin like dai, which is pegged to the US dollar, with low risk, there is a good incentive to get serious about moving fiat currency and other current investments into crypto. When you compare that to earning 2% on your savings in a conventional banking institution, it makes a lot of sense to invest. So for me lending/borrowing is one of the best and biggest use cases for smart contracts. Another emerging area of huge potential is \\"staking\\", as we move from Proof of work to Proof of stake consensus models, with the next generation of blockchain projects.\\n\\nHere is a list of areas that I would like to explor and discuss. I got this list from an article from stakingrewards.com (full article is at https://blog.stakingrewards.com/7-ways-to-earn-passive-income-with-cryptocurrencies/#) It serves as a good outline for the topics that I want to cover in future posts, and areas that I am interested in. \\n\\nPart I: Developed Reward Opportunities\\n     1. Staking tokens with network validators\\n\\n     2. Work Tokens (Resource Provision)\\n\\n     3. Lending/Borrowing\\n\\nPart II: Currently Underdeveloped Opportunities\\n    4. Market Making Liquidity\\n\\n    5. Payment Channels\\n\\n    6. Security Tokens\\n\\n    7. Algorithmic Trading\\n\\nThanks to Gleb Dudka and  Mirko Schmiedl for writing this article.  It will serve as a good outline for the topics that I want to cover in future posts. If you find this interesting, please comment, and let me know what you think.\\n\\nPS - What is meant by Defi and Opfi?\\n\\nDefi - Decentrlized finance - Anonymous (No KYC) and decentralised, autonomous smart contract based finance (Ex. Compound finance project)\\n\\nOpfi - Open finance - transparent and community based finance, which may not be decentralised. (ex. Celsius finance project)\\n\\nMore detail to come in future posts ..."}',

[Linux](#)\\n2.  macOS\\n3.  Windows\\n\\nHaving some powerful tools in your toolbelt is essential for a Java developer, and one of the crucial tools for an Ethereum blockchain developer is the network client. This is the piece of software that communicates data to and from the blockchain. Among other things, the client: spins up nodes, acts as a peer discovery agent to see who else is participating in the network and validates and sends transactions.\\n\\nThis guide helps you install and setup this core part you need for programming on Ethereum with Java. Although there are some great networking clients out there, Pantheon is the only one written in Java.\\n\\nPantheon is an open-source, Apache 2.0 licensed Ethereum client written in Java. It is mainnet compatible, has a modular architecture, and has privacy and permissioning features as well as new consensus algorithms.\\n\\nThis is the first of a series of step-by-step guides to install and configure the Pantheon client on Linux/macOS/Windows. This guide focuses on Linux operating system, but you can use many of the commands and steps on macOS with some basic modifications.\\n\\n## Try Pantheon with Docker\\n\\nBefore installing, I would suggest anyone wanting to setup and install Pantheon for the first time to try it out using our [Docker images](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Getting-Started/Run-Docker-Image/). The requirements to do so are having [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and using Linux or macOS.\\nYou can use a single docker command to run a mainnet, local or rinkeby version of Pantheon, and then use [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) or similar tools to get or post data to the running node.\\n\\n> For quick, temporary tests this guide uses `/tmp/pantheon/dev/`, `/tmp/pantheon/mainnet/`, `/tmp/pantheon/rinkeby/` as mount volumes, which are automatically cleaned at every boot. You can create other folders instead, but whichever option you choose, make sure you create the folders first.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ mkdir -p /tmp/pantheon/dev/\\n$ mkdir -p /tmp/pantheon/mainnet/\\n$ mkdir -p /tmp/pantheon/rinkeby/\\n```\\n\\nHere are some examples:\\n\\nMainnet Node:\\n\\n```shell\\ndocker run pegasyseng/pantheon:latest\\n```\\n\\nLocal test Node with Websockets and HTTP RPC services enabled:\\n\\n```shell\\ndocker run -p 8545:8545 -p 8546:8546 --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/pantheon/dev,target=/var/lib/pantheon pegasyseng/pantheon:latest --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73 --rpc-http-cors-origins=\\"all\\" --rpc-ws-enabled --network=dev\\n```\\n\\nRinkeby Node:\\n\\n```shell\\ndocker run -p 30303:30303 --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/pantheon/rinkeby,target=/var/lib/pantheon pegasyseng/pantheon:latest --network=rinkeby\\n```\\n\\nWhile the node is running, you can use another terminal window to interact with the node.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kw1VHDs.png)\\n\\nFor example, using `curl` to call the `eth_chainId` RPC method:\\n\\n```shell\\ncurl -X POST --data \'{\\"jsonrpc\\":\\"2.0\\",\\"method\\":\\"eth_chainId\\",\\"params\\":[],\\"id\\":1}\' localhost:8545\\n```\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Getting started with Linux\\n\\nTwo installation methods are available:\\n\\n-   [Installing the binary distribution](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Installation/Install-Binaries/)\\n    For binary installation, [follow along to this section](#binary-install) and skip the next.\\n-   [Building from source](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Installation/Build-From-Source/)\\n    For building from source, [skip to this section](#build-from-source).\\n\\n> **Requirements**: For both of these methods, Pantheon needs the Java JDK installed on your machine. Current versions of Pantheon require Java JDK 11+ installed.\\n\\n### Binary install\\n\\nRemember to have at least 4GB of RAM if running a private network, and [review  the further requirements](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Installation/Overview/#disk-space-and-ram-requirements) for other installation types.\\n\\n1.  [Download the Pantheon binaries](https://bintray.com/consensys/pegasys-repo/pantheon/_latestVersion#files).\\n\\nYou can use `wget` to do this.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ sudo apt install wget\\n$ cd ~/bin/\\n$ wget   https://bintray.com/consensys/pegasys-repo/download_file?file_path=pantheon-1.1.4.tar.gz -O pantheon-1.1.4.tar.gz\\n$ wget https://bintray.com/consensys/pegasys-repo/download_file\\\\?file_path\\\\=pantheon-1.1.4.tar.gz -O pantheon-1.1.4.tar.gz\\n```\\n\\n> `$HOME/bin/` and `$HOME/.local/{bin,opt,usr}` are the recommended install folders for local user binaries on machines used by a single user. Other options are available such as `/opt/local/` or `/usr/local/bin/` depending on your local setup and preference. [Read this Stack Exchange thread for more details](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/36871/where-should-a-local-executable-be-placed).\\n\\n2.  Unpack the compressed file:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ tar -xzf pantheon-1.1.4.tar.gz\\n$ cd pantheon-1.1.4\\n```\\n\\n> Replace 1.1.4 with whichever release you downloaded.\\n\\n3.  Confirm the download isn\'t corrupted and check the version .The output should return the Pantheon and JDK version.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ bin/pantheon --version\\npantheon/v1.1.4/linux-x86_64/oracle_openjdk-java-11\\n```\\n\\n### Build from Source\\n\\nTwo options are available: [installing and running locally](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Installation/Build-From-Source/#installation-on-linux-unix-mac-os-x) or [on a VM](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Installation/Build-From-Source/#installation-on-vm).\\n\\nThis guide focuses on the local solution.\\n\\n1.  Clone the Pantheon codebase\\n\\n```shell\\n$ cd ~/bin/\\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon.git\\n```\\n\\n2.  Build Pantheon\\n\\n```shell\\n$ cd pantheon/\\n$ ./gradlew build -x test\\n```\\n\\n3.  Choose distribution version and check version.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ cd build/distributions/\\n$ tar -xzf pantheon-1.1.4.tar.gz\\n$ cd pantheon-1.1.4/\\n$ bin/pantheon --version\\n$ bin/pantheon --help\\n```\\n\\n## Config\\n\\nNo additional configuration is necessary for Pantheon to run correctly.\\nEach different network type (including mainnet) set by the `--network` command line flags automatically loads the appropriate default configuration.\\n\\nIf you need to change the settings, these options are either configured at Node or Network-level.\\nNetwork-level settings are defined in the genesis file and are loaded by every Node connected to that specific network. Whereas Node-level settings are modified either in the node configuration file, or through command line flags.\\n\\nFor more information on configuration, [read the corresponding documentation](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Configuring-Pantheon/Network-vs-Node/).\\n\\n## Starting Pantheon\\n\\nAfter you have completed the above steps, you can continue using this distribution with the [regular Starting Pantheon guide](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Getting-Started/Starting-Pantheon/).\\n\\nFor a quick preview, this could be an HTTP request on a `dev` network Node running with docker.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ docker run -p 8545:8545 --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/pantheon/dev,target=/var/lib/pantheon pegasyseng/pantheon:latest --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73 --rpc-http-cors-origins=\\"all\\" --rpc-http-enabled --network=dev\\n```\\n\\nThis is how you build a request calling the `eth_chainId` method.\\n\\n```java\\nString payload=\'{\\"jsonrpc\\":\\"2.0\\",\\"method\\":\\"eth_chainId\\",\\"params\\":[],\\"id\\":1}\';\\nString requestUrl=\\"http://localhost:8545\\";\\nsendRequest(requestUrl, payload);\\n```\\n\\nAnd the method implementation:\\n\\n```java\\npublic static String sendRequest(String requestUrl, String payload) {\\n    try {\\n        URL url = new URL(requestUrl);\\n        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\\n\\n        connection.setDoInput(true);\\n        connection.setDoOutput(true);\\n        connection.setRequestMethod(\\"GET\\");\\n        connection.setRequestProperty(\\"Accept\\", \\"application/json\\");\\n        connection.setRequestProperty(\\"Content-Type\\", \\"application/json; charset=UTF-8\\");\\n        OutputStreamWriter outputWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(connection.getOutputStream(), \\"UTF-8\\");\\n\\n        outputWriter.write(payload);\\n        outputWriter.close();\\n\\n        BufferedReader buffer = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));\\n        StringBuffer jsonString = new StringBuffer();\\n        String line;\\n        while ((line = buffer.readLine()) != null) {\\n                jsonString.append(line);\\n        }\\n        buffer.close();\\n\\n        connection.disconnect();\\n        return jsonString.toString();\\n    } catch (Exception e) {\\n            throw new RuntimeException(e.getMessage());\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThat request should return the following result:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"jsonrpc\\" : \\"2.0\\",\\n  \\"id\\" : 1,\\n  \\"result\\" : {\\n    \\"startingBlock\\" : \\"0x0\\",\\n    \\"currentBlock\\" : \\"0x2d0\\",\\n    \\"highestBlock\\" : \\"0x66c0\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFine more information in the [Pantheon documentation](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/)."}',

Arguments can either be indexed or non-indexed; with indexed arguments allowing for efficient off-chain querying.\\n\\n> For example, if event X contains an indexed string argument Y, off-chain I can retrieve all events where Y == \\"foo\\", using a filter. (More on filters later)\\n\\nEvents are stored as logs rather than within EVM storage, and because of this, they have properties that you should be aware of:\\n\\n-   **Not accessible from within a smart contract:** Although smart contract functions emit events, smart contracts cannot access this event information after emission.  This is true for both the emitting contract and any other external contract. Therefore, you cannot use events for cross-contract communication.\\n\\n-   **Events are cheap!:** As events are stored as logs, they are cheap compared to the traditional approach of updating the EVM storage state.  The exact cost depends on the event specification and the size of the data within the event.\\n\\n## Common Uses for Events\\n\\n### Asynchronous Off-chain Triggers\\n\\nMost enterprise Java developers are familiar with the Event Bus pattern, where events are published to a queue such as RabbitMQ or Amazon SQS.  This pattern allows services that are interested in specific events to consume them off the bus asynchronously, and perform further processing, without any coupling between the publisher and consumer services.\\n\\n_The Event Bus Pattern_\\n![](https://api.dev2.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmUwbWrK2kgPz2RpwghveWcgRQsH1BSiQhHtam6hFpxp1J)\\n\\nServices can use Ethereum smart contract events in a similar way, with the Ethereum network acting as a kind of messaging queue.  Off-chain services can register an event filter with a node, and will subsequently be notified each time this event is emitted in the Ethereum network.  You can then use these event notifications as a trigger for further off-chain processing, such as updating a NoSQL based cache of the smart contract state.\\n\\n_Ethereum as an \'Event Bus\'_\\n![](https://api.dev2.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmaMerpsdaU6xMT7QfJpfCa8ttZa9DuiGDrQaA7GzRiY9d)\\n\\n### Cheap Data Storage for Off-chain Consumption\\n\\nAs I mentioned above, storing data within an event rather than in EVM contract storage is significantly cheaper.\\n\\n> Diving a little bit into the specifics in order to compare, saving 32 bytes of data to contract storage costs 20,000 gas, whereas emitting an event costs 375 plus 375 for each indexed argument, and an additional 8 gas per byte of data.\\n\\nDue to these cost savings, it\'s a common pattern to store data never read by an on-chain smart contract function soley in an event, not in contract storage.\\n\\nAn example of a scenario where this may be the case, is a notary service where an IPFS hash is committed to the Ethereum blockchain in order to prove date of creation.  After an event has been emitted which contains the IPFS hash of the document, you can verify the timestamp of the notarisation off-chain if there is a dispute by querying the contract events, not the contract state.\\n\\n## Defining and Emitting an Event\\n\\nBoth defining and emitting and event within your Ethereum smart contracts are one liners:\\n\\n### Defining\\n\\n```solidity\\nevent Notarized(address indexed notary, string documentHash)\\n```\\n\\nIn this example we defined an event with the name `Notarized`, with an indexed address argument, `notary`,  and a single non-indexed string parameter, `documentHash`.\\n\\n### Emitting\\n\\n```solidity\\nfunction notarizeDocument(string _documentHash) public {\\n        emit Notarized(msg.sender, _documentHash);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe emit keyword fires an event, with arguments passed to the event in a way that is similar to function invocation.  Here, the notary address is set as the transaction sender address via `msg.sender`, and the `documentHash` is the same as the called function argument.\\n\\n## Listening for Emitted Events with Web3j\\n\\nBy far the easiest way to listen for Ethereum smart contract events using web3j is to use the contract wrapper feature of the library.  For a primer on the wrapper feature, see the previous post in this series [http://todo.com](here).\\n\\nThe below code snippet connects to a local Ethereum node and listens for all Notarized events emitted from a deployed Notary contract:\\n\\n```java\\nWeb3j web3j = Web3j.build(new HttpService(\\"http://localhost:8545\\"));\\n\\n//Deploys a notary contract via wrapper\\nfinal Notary notaryContract = deployNotaryContract(web3j);\\n\\nnotaryContract\\n        .notarizedEventFlowable(DefaultBlockParameterName.EARLIEST, DefaultBlockParameterName.LATEST)\\n        .subscribe(event -> {\\n            final String notary = event.notary;\\n            final String documentHash = event.documentHash;\\n\\n            //Perform processing based on event values\\n        });\\n```\\n\\nThe autogenerated contract wrapper code contains convenience methods for each event defined in your smart contract with the naming pattern `<event-name>EventFlowable`.  This method takes start and end block arguments, and as in this example, using the `DefaultBlockParameterName.LATEST` value instructs web3j to continue listening for events for new blocks indefinitely.  If you require a specific block range, you can use `DefaultBlockParameter.valueOf(BigInteger.valueOf(...))`.  A [Flowable](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Flowable.html) object is returned which can then be subscribed to, in order to perform processing logic on emitted events.\\n\\nThis method simplifies the process of event listening, as it automatically converts the raw log messages into an object with fields reflecting the defined event arguments.  Without this, you would have to decode the values yourself, and although web3j provides helper methods for this, things can get complex quickly.\\n\\n### Filtering by Indexed Argument Value\\n\\nSetting an argument of an event as `indexed` faciliates efficient querying of events by that arguments value.  This querying is supported in Web3j by building an `EthFilter` object manually.  Below is the code to listen for events notarized by a specific Ethereum address:\\n\\n```java\\nfinal EthFilter ethFilter = new EthFilter(DefaultBlockParameterName.EARLIEST, DefaultBlockParameterName.LATEST,\\n                notaryContract.getContractAddress());\\n\\nethFilter.addSingleTopic(EventEncoder.encode(notaryContract.NOTARIZED_EVENT));\\nethFilter.addOptionalTopics(\\"0x\\" + TypeEncoder.encode(new Address(\\"0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72\\")));\\n\\nnotaryContract\\n        .notarizedEventFlowable(ethFilter)\\n        .subscribe(event -> {\\n            final String notary = event.notary;\\n            final String documentHash = event.documentHash;\\n\\n            //Perform processing based on event values\\n        });\\n```\\n\\nThe `notarizedEventFlowable` is overloaded, and can accept an `EthFilter` as an argument, rather than a block range.  This filter is used to define which events to listen for in a more finely grained way, and is built up with the same block range as was previously passed to the method.\\n\\nThere are also some topics that are set on the filter.  In an Ethereum filter, the first topic is always defined as the keccak hash of the event signature, with the event signature in our case being `\'Notarised(address,string)\'\'`.  This is calculated with the help of the `EventEncoder.encode(..)` method provided by Web3j, along with the event specification, `NOTARIZED_EVENT` that has been auto-generated in the wrapper class.\\n\\nAdditional topics can be added using the `addOptionalTopics(..)` method, and these specify the values of indexed arguments to match against, in the same order as they are defined in the event specification.  Encoding varies slightly based on the type of the argument, but luckily, Web3j provides the `TypeEncoder` class which handles this for us.  In the example provided, we are only listening for events where the `notary` value is the address 0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72.\\n\\n## Summary\\nEvents are a great way for backend (and frontend) services to be notified of smart contract changes and interactions in an asynchronous manner, as well a providing a cost effective way of storing data on the Ethereum blockchain that does not need to be consumed by a smart contract.\\n\\nAs with many Ethereum interactions, the smart contract wrappers generated by Web3j are by far the simplest way to subscribe to, and process emitted events in your java backend.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\n**Next Steps:**\\n- [Using Pantheon, the Java Ethereum Client with Linux](https://kauri.io/article/276dd27f1458443295eea58403fd6965)\\n"}',
