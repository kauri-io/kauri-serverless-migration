The lack of documentation stems from the fast-paced and rapidly changing business models being driven by the Ethereum ecosystem, which is ripe — and sometimes saturated — with new protocols, crypto-mechanisms, and software on a seemingly weekly basis.\\n\\nThough the Ethereum community is deeply collaborative and open sourced, a support structure isn’t in place yet for community members to efficiently curate essential resources and help one another answer technical questions. Project teams trying to bring products into the ecosystem know all too well the current state of affairs: time offering support to others is often time away from shipping new features or from actually improving the core technology. Most offer support for free, and those that do monetize their services are disproportionately larger companies with brand name recognition and strong balance sheets. Small to medium sized startups lack access to pay-as-you-need support models, and a viable open source support network is yet to emerge.\\n\\nIf the products, platforms, protocols, and software of the Ethereum ecosystem are to thrive, the knowledge share must thrive as well. Conceived as a portal where project teams and individuals can engage, generate, and curate high quality and up-to-date technical resources, the Kauri project is committed to enabling the community to curate the decentralized knowledge base and support network that the Ethereum ecosystem needs to reach its full potential. Our name is taken from the _Kauri_ tree, which is native to New Zealand and one of the oldest and largest trees on the planet. We see the Kauri network as a community-grown tree of knowledge which stands to support further innovation, adoption, and collaboration in the developer ecosystem.\\n\\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*OOXE6y6nBaZRMG5f.)\\n\\n\\n### Learn: Search, Engage, Bounty\\nUsers will be able to search the Kauri network for tutorials, examples, and documentation on libraries, developer tools, blockchain clients, application protocols, and any Ethereum content in general. If a user can’t find the knowledge they are looking for, they can make a request and choose to attach an ether based bounty to incentivize community members to lend their expertise and knowledge. Community members also have the opportunity to tip existing articles that they’ve found helpful. For both seasoned developers migrating from Web2 and newcomers touching the command line for the first time in Web3, Kauri will serve as a reputable and ever-growing body of knowledge that builders can leverage to bring themselves up to speed and build faster.\\n\\n### Contribute: Incentives for Experts\\nKauri aims to accelerate the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem through community-based knowledge and provide innovative ways for those building decentralized tech to make available and, if they want, monetize their expertise. Through Kauri, community members can monetize their expertise by fulfilling requests and contributing articles, tutorials, and rigorous examples to projects’ knowledge bases. Contributors can also be recognized by the community and specific projects for the content they create. In the future, we plan to introduce reputation mechanisms that will be interoperable with other decentralized and reputation-based marketplaces so users can build reputations across different networks.\\n\\n### Support: Submit and Answer Requests\\nOn the Kauri network, anyone can submit a request, and anyone with the requisite knowledge can answer any public request. Kauri’s UI functionality allows users to ask follow-up questions should they need more requestor input. Additionally, users are not confined to any one role, and are actually encouraged to contribute in any way they feel can add value to the network.\\n\\n### Beta Launch, Competition, and Roadmap Preview\\nThe Kauri MVP public beta will launch on Rinkeby in May 2018 with a limited subset of ecosystem projects. To celebrate the launch of the Kauri beta, we’ll be kicking off a four-week knowledge content competition in parallel. Beta users and content creators in our competition will be rewarded with real Ether and prizes. We’ll follow up with competition details and initial projects soon, so stay tuned!\\nOver the course of 2018 and 2019, we plan to build out Kauri’s application and protocol layers so the Ethereum community can better self-organize and build the technical knowledge base together.\\n **Extended Roadmap Preview** (subject to change)\\n _Q4 2018––MVP live on mainnet with enhanced features_ \\n\\n\\n\\n * Process for keeping articles up-to-date\\n\\n * Article versioning and multi-ownership\\n\\n * Off-chain articles and escalation\\n\\n * Bounties network integration\\n _FY 2019_ \\n\\n\\n\\n * Community-curated topic channels\\n\\n * Contributor reputation\\n\\n * P2P technical support\\n\\nKauri will provide both new and experienced developers with completely free access to a curated, high-quality, and continuously expanding Ethereum knowledge base. The point is less time searching and vetting, and more time learning and building. The Kauri network is not owned and operated by a single gatekeeper but rather aligns incentives and facilitates community members so that participants themselves can curate and grow the network. Experts will be rewarded for sharing time and expertise. In turn, development teams will finally be able to harness the full resources and support of the incredibly talented Ethereum community. We look forward to unlocking our ecosystem’s collective wisdom.\\nAre you interested in building a community of knowledge contributors for your open source project?

Thank you to all those who submitted content, requested content, and everyone else who offered us invaluable feedback throughout the Rinkeby launch competition.\\n\\n### Best Overall Contribution and Notable Submissions\\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to highlight Erick Kusnadi (alias: handsomecodemonkey) as the winner of best overall contribution and as most prolific writer. For his contributions, he was awarded the equivalent of $4,000 in ETH. In addition to the Kauri sponsored prizes, several MakerDAO project-specific mainnet bounties were fulfilled.\\nBelow are the notable submissions that occurred during the Rinkeby launch competition:\\n\\n\\n\\n *  **MakerDAO** — “MakerDAO — Alerting Tutorial for CDP Owners” [https://rinkeby.kauri.io/article/ad3837c1f403453a9368304e3d272087](https://rinkeby.kauri.io/article/ad3837c1f403453a9368304e3d272087) \\n\\n *  **Remix** — “Using truffle-flattener to import code into Remix” [https://rinkeby.kauri.io/article/18edb0f1ffdb4d10b88949835d91513d](https://rinkeby.kauri.io/article/18edb0f1ffdb4d10b88949835d91513d) \\n\\n *  **MakerDAO** — “What are the risks/rewards associated with leveraging?” [https://rinkeby.kauri.io/article/1afc125f25b34c3dac3de8934671e833](https://rinkeby.kauri.io/article/1afc125f25b34c3dac3de8934671e833) \\n\\n *  **MetaMask —** “Experimenting with web3 calls in MetaMask — Part 1” [https://rinkeby.kauri.io/article/345aa1f7d425436aae5165d75430c097](https://rinkeby.kauri.io/article/345aa1f7d425436aae5165d75430c097) \\nThe submission of these articles evidences the need for a decentralized network where developers are incentivized to share and profit from their domain expertise. These articles highlight the various workflows and tools that developers are utilizing, and. It further opens up threads for discussion, where best practices can be shared, and where others with similar domain expertise can offer suggestions and feedback where appropriate.\\nNew developers entering the space will have before them an open community with ongoing discussion that they canto leverage, learn from, build on top of, and ultimately contribute to when comfortable.\\n\\n### Final Stats Roundup\\nAs of publishing this competition roundup, 54 total articles have been written on the network. Below are the key metrics recorded during the competition:\\n \\n**Onboard users**\\n Goal: 100  \\n Actual: 85 (non-team)\\n \\n**Unique page views**\\n   \\n Goal: 1000  \\n Actual: 1400\\n \\n**Onboard key providers**\\n   \\n Goal: 5  \\n Actual: 9\\n \\n**Generate quality requests**\\n   \\n Goal: 15  \\n Actual: 26 (15 with mainnet ETH/ERC20)\\n \\n**Generate content (articles)**\\n   \\n Goal: 10  \\n Actual: 8, 2 rewarded with bounties, 1 submitted and not accepted\\n\\n### Lessons Learned and Improvements on the Horizon\\n \\n**Article updating and versioning:**\\n We identified early on that Kauri lacks a mechanism to update articles, and sowe are diligently working on introducing an article versioning mechanism to resolve this primary issue.\\n \\n**Improved editor experience:**\\n We are exploring changes that will implement Markdown language compatibility and we fully intend to continue smoothing out the user experience.\\n \\n**Improved approval process and introduction of non-approval publishing:**\\n We are looking to improve the article approval process between contributor and moderator to be more smooth and user-friendly.\\n\\n### Keep Exploring: Kauri Still Live on Rinkeby, Active Bounties and Ether Rewards\\nOur most salient observation is that projects that devoted more time towards interacting with their contributors reaped the most meaningful content. We find this interesting and reaffirming, as we designed Kauri to flourish as a community. We really wanted to emphasize collaboration within the Ethereum development ecosystem and we are ecstatic to see some interesting contributor / requestor dynamics emerging.\\nAlthough the competition is over, 86 bounties with real ether rewards are still available for anyone to claim on the network. Kauri is still live on Rinkeby! Looking for answers to Web3 development questions? Want to contribute to high-profile projects in the ecosystem, like MetaMask, Dharma, Aragon, and Zeppelin? \\n[Access Kauri](https://rinkeby.kauri.io/)\\n and explore the Ethereum community’s self-organized knowledge base.

                      "{\"markdown\":\"#Part III - Dapps and Libraries\\n\\nThis is a QA update\\n\\n###How an End-User Would Interact with Your Decentralized App\\n\\nUsing ethereumjs to execute a raw transaction is quite an arduous code-heavy process for such a simple task. MetaMask is one such decentralized application that serves to improve the user experience of transacting on the Ethereum network while protecting the end-users private keys. \\n\\nLet’s execute a simple transaction using MetaMask. First, if you haven’t added the app to your Chrome or Firefox browser, go ahead and do that now at the following link: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/) then move through the steps and setup a password. \\n\\n![](https://api.beta.kauri.io:443/ipfs/Qmen7cYubP4VBcVDYivwaqfVieK1Eno18RhEZhKcHWCM6v)\\n\\nThe above is what the MetaMask end-user sees when sending a transaction. It’s both immensely more intuitive and easy. Using this decentralized application, most transactions can be broadcast out to the Ethereum mainnet and testnets within a minute. \\n\\nIn the top left corner you can see that this transaction was broadcast onto the the Rinkeby testnet. The 18.750 ETH is not real ether, as it was obtained using Rinkeby’s faucet @ [https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).\\n\\n##Web3 Libraries\\n_Interacting with the Ethereum network occurs through use of various Web3 libraries, each of which represent or are built for a specific language or programming protocol._\\n\\nThere are various libraries that allow developers and end-users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, among these are the ethereumjs modules (which we used “ethereumjs-tx” earlier to sign and execute a raw transaction), web3.js, and pyEVM.\\n\\nWeb3.js is the Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec. The Web3.js library is available on npm as a node module, for browsers and components it is available as an embeddable js, and is further available as a meteor.js package. Web3js communicates via RPC with the local node or test node. \\n\\nAlthough Web3.js is the de facto JavaScript Ethereum API, developers have access to a plethora of other libraries and tools. Among these are web3j (a more lightweight, reactive type safe Java and Android API), ethereum-js (the simple library we used above to execute a raw transaction), pyEVM (python library seen as the incoming replacement of pyethereum), Web3.py (another Python library), eth.js (maintained by Nick Dodson), and a long rendition of other libraries. \\n        \\nDevelopment environments such as Truffle, which we will describe in greater detail later, utilize consoles that can access Web3 libraries. \\n\\nEthereum can be accessed by a browser, a server, and in general anything that can correctly interpret the protocol. An example of a client-side browser interface is ConsenSys’ MetaMask browser extension, which uses the Web3.js API. An example of a server-side service is etherscan.io, a service that many in the ethereum community see as a generally reliable source for information on ethereum addresses, address balances, and smart contracts. \\n\\n| Web3 library | Quick overview |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) | The sort of ‘flagship’ Ethereum library, it is the Javascript API implementing the Generic JSON-RPC spec. |\\n| [py-evm](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm) | New python implementation intended on replacing pyethereum. |\\n| [Web3j](https://github.com/web3j/web3j) | Java library built to be lightweight and modular. |\\n| [ethereumjs modules](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-lib) | We used ethereumjs-tx to complete our raw transaction. Ethereumjs Github states that their library is outdated, but refers users to a set of modules you can find in the link to the right. |\\n| [eth.js](https://github.com/ethjs/ethjs) | Lightweight and modular JavaScript library. |\\n\\n\\n##Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\\n_The EVM is a sandboxed runtime environment designed for smart contract development. It is completely isolated from the internet and external file systems, and provides users deterministic algorithmic outcome for their smart contract development needs._\\n\\nNow we have a basic understanding of Ethereum. We understand basic account structures, how to execute a transaction, how to execute a transaction with a contract, and so forth. Let’s now delve into the more complex nuances of Ethereum that make it so special. \\n\\nWe’ve seen the EVM mentioned throughout this article, but haven’t gone into significant detail about its capabilities. The EVM is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, it is the Turing complete virtual machine that handles all of the transaction processing on the Ethereum network. It is a complete 256 bit virtual machine that serves to execute arbitrary EVM bytecode. \\n\\n###EVM Byte Code\\n\\nOn the current Ethereum blockchain, the EVM generally executes received byte code slower than one would expect of other virtual machines. The salient reason for this is that each operation must be executed simultaneously by every full node in the network in order to achieve a trust-less environment. This is by design. The EVM was designed to achieve decentralized consensus across the whole network, and as a result, computation speeds and costs tend to be greater than one would find on a centralized network. The upside is that Ethereum network experiences immutability, significantly improved fault tolerance, and zero downtime. \\n\\nAdditionally, while not contributing to slower byte code execution, the gas mechanism ensures that miners receive an upfront payment to complete the transaction. This prevents programs from looping eternally, eventually the program will exhaust its gas limit and the transaction will throw. The gas costs are split into two variables, gas price and gas limit, which we will review next. \\n\\n###Explanation of Gas Costs\\n\\nEach transaction received by the EVM contains a gasLimit and a gasPrice set by the transaction sender. The gasLimit is the maximum gas allotted to the transaction, and it is paid to the EVM upfront. The gasPrice is the pre-allocated value of gas that the sender is willing to pay for each computational step. The EVM continues through its single run loop until the byte code is finished and terminated, or if an exception is thrown when all pre-allotted gas has been exhausted. Any remaining gas is refunded to the transaction sender. \\n\\nOther exceptions that will force the EVM to terminate the transaction are invalid opcodes, invalid jump destinations (the EVM is able to jump to arbitrary positions only if lands on a jump-destination), and stack underflows. \\n\\nWithout going into greater details, it’s important to mention that the go-ethereum repository implements two EVM interpreters. The first being a simple byte code interpreter that performs simple loops over the byte code. The second being a ‘JIT-like’ interpreter, of which has received upgrades converting big integer arithmetic into 64 bit, that compiles the byte code into manageable data types and structures. More information on these interpreters and their performance variance can be found here: [https://medium.com/@jeff.ethereum/optimising-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-58457e61ca15](https://medium.com/@jeff.ethereum/optimising-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-58457e61ca15)\\n\\nWhile on the topic of gas costs, it is worthwhile to understand the various Ethereum units. Ether is naturally the most discussed, as it is the intrinsic currency of Ether. However, there are many sub-denominations of Ether. For example, one Ether is 1018 wei. Please reference the web3js unitMap variable below for the full breakdown of sub-denominations: [https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/blob/0.15.0/lib/utils/utils.js#L40](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/blob/0.15.0/lib/utils/utils.js#L40)\\n\\nIn our tutorial above, where we executed a raw transaction, the EVM is the processor that carries out that transaction. \\n\\nAdditional resources you may find helpful: \\n- ETH Gas Station: To estimate the estimate the costs of particular transaction and contract execution, the ETH Gas Station can be used: [https://ethgasstation.info/](https://ethgasstation.info/)\\n- Infura: Developers, in your search of  scalable infrastructure for your dapps, will find solace in Infura. For several years, Infura has been providing the greater Ethereum community scalable access to the Web3 API through their infrastructure of geth, parity, and IPFS nodes. \\n- Infura API: In addition to the Web3 API, the Infura team provides their own API, which contains within it a RESTful APIs, Market Data APIs, and Security APIs.

Solidity is currently the de facto primary language used to write smart contracts. It is a high level language that draws influences from Python, JavaScript, and C++. Viper and Serpent are two additional smart contract languages, though they are not used to the extent that Solidity is. \\n\\nAs discussed in the preceding section, EVM byte code can be both time intensive and expensive to execute, since it must be simultaneously accepted and executed by every full node in the network. Smart contracts perform best when they’re written to handle straightforward logic. As smart contracts grow more complex, they tend to cost the transaction sender more gas. Additionally, unnecessarily robust smart contracts introduce more potential attack vectors for malicious actors to exploit. It is best to keep smart contracts as simple as possible. \\n\\nBelow is a sample escrow smart contract that you could drop into a Remix virtual machine instance and interact with and manipulate to your liking: \\n`pragma solidity ^0.4.11;\\n\\ncontract Escrow {\\n    address owner = msg.sender; // sets owner to whoever created this contract\\n    address receiver; // Specifies who can withdraw money from this contract\\n    address approver; // Specifies who has authority to release the value\\n    bool approved = false; // Specifies whether the 'approved' has released the value\\n\\n    // Should be called by the 'approver' authority so that 'receiver'\\n    // can withdraw current stored value\\n    \\n    function Escrow(address _receiver, address _approver) {\\n        receiver = _receiver;\\n        approver = _approver;\\n    }\\n\\n    modifier onlyReceiver() {\\n        require(msg.sender == receiver);\\n        _;\\n    }\\n\\n    modifier onlyApprover() {\\n        require(msg.sender == approver);\\n        _;\\n    }\\n    \\n    function approve() onlyApprover {\\n        approved = true;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Called by 'receiver' to withdraw funds\\n    function withdraw() onlyReceiver payable {\\n        require(approved);\\n        assert(receiver.send(this.balance));\\n        approved = false;\\n    }\\n\\n    // This function is called by customers to make payments\\n    function() payable {}\\n}\\n`\\n###Remaining Cognizant of Smart Contract Security\\n\\nIf you simply want to try your hand at coding Solidity smart contracts in a virtual environment, then access Remix via your browser @ [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/) then navigate to the ‘Run’ tab and set the environment field to ‘JavaScript VM.’ Using this method, all transactions will be executed in a sandbox virtual environment within your browser. \\n\\nNow that you’re moving along and building and deploying smart contracts, you’ll want to ensure that you’re writing secure code. After all, smart contracts are immutable once written to the blockchain. Learning to write secure smart contracts is a difficult endeavor. Tools such as [Mythril](https://consensys.net/diligence/mythril.html) help devs identify vulnerabilities in their smart contracts. Further, it is suggested that users who have a desire to improve their knowledge in this area reference the documents available @ [https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices)\\n\\nSecondly, developers within the Ethereum community saw the inherent need for improved smart contract frameworks, and as a result, various tools and libraries such as Zeppelin Open source have emerged that offer developers secure, community reviewed smart contracts that can be inherited. \\n\\nAdditionally, as Ethereum grows and scales, so will the demand for smart contract security auditing professionals. To date, there have been several high profile smart contract attacks (e.g. the DAO, Parity wallet hacks) that have both shaped and influenced ethereum’s development and resulted in the loss of large sums of money. The DAO attack significantly shaped and divided the Ethereum community, resulting in the forking of Ethereum Classic. \\n\\nThe environments we will discuss throughout the next section are both a good springboard to more advanced smart contract development, testing, and auditing tools and offer developers the ability to tailor their development environment to their needs and abilities. \\n\"}",
