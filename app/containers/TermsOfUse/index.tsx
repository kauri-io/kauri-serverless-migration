                                    arbitration, the party must first send to
                                    the other party a written Notice of Dispute
                                    (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis

                                    sent to: 49 Bogart St. #22, Brooklyn, New
                                    York 11206. After the Notice is received,

                                    the claim or dispute informally. If you and

                                    Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be
                                    initiated through the American Arbitration
                                    Association (“AAA”), an established
                                    alternative dispute resolution provider
                                    (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as
                                    set forth in this section. If AAA is not
                                    available to arbitrate, the parties shall
                                    agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.
                                    The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern
                                    all aspects of the arbitration, including
                                    but not limited to the method of initiating
                                    and/or demanding arbitration, except to the
                                    extent such rules are in conflict with the
                                    Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules
                                    (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the
                                    arbitration are available online at
                                    www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at
                                    1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be
                                    conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.
                                    Any claims or disputes where the total
                                    amount of the award sought is less than Ten
                                    Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be
                                    resolved through binding
                                    non-appearance-based arbitration, at the
                                    option of the party seeking relief. For
                                    claims or disputes where the total amount of
                                    the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.
                                    Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right
                                    to a hearing will be determined by the
                                    Arbitration Rules. Any judgment on the award
                                    rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
                                    any court of competent jurisdiction. If the
                                    arbitrator grants you an award that is
                                    greater than the last settlement offer that
                                    the Company made to you prior to the
                                    initiation of arbitration, the Company will

                                    $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own
                                    costs (including attorney’s fees) and
                                    disbursements arising out of the arbitration
                                    and shall pay an equal share of the fees and
                                    costs of the ADR Provider.

                                    initiated and/or demanded within the statute

                                    Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is
                                    initiated, the arbitrator will decide the
                                    rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
                                    the Company, and the dispute will not be

                                    joined with any other cases or parties. The
                                    arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
                                    motions dispositive of all or part of any
                                    claim. The arbitrator shall have the
                                    authority to award monetary damages, and to
                                    grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
                                    available to an individual under applicable

                                    arbitrator shall issue a written award and
                                    statement of decision describing the
                                    essential findings and conclusions on which
                                    the award is based, including the
                                    calculation of any damages awarded. The
                                    arbitrator has the same authority to award
                                    relief on an individual basis that a judge
                                    in a court of law would have. The award of
                                    the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
                                    and the Company.

                            invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
                            modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the
